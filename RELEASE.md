# How to release a new version of the packages

For each package make sure the version in the
`packages/<PACKAGE_NAME>/deno.json` is set correctly and stick to semantic
versioning.

Once everything is ready make a new commit with a message of this type:

```
chore: release 0.0.0
```

Push to `main` and create a new release on GitHub from there on the GitHub
workflow will take care of the rest.

## Manually publish to JSR

```
cd packages/<PACKAGE_NAME>
deno publish
```
